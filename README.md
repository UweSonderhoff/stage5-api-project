# stage5-api-project
Creating a website using an API to show a google map

First: download the file called ascii-chan-ipnd-incomplete listed in the Materials section.

This code will let you follow along with this lesson, which picks up with an example that you haven't seen.

In the rest of this lesson, you will take a web app like this:

http://ascii-chan-ipnd-incomplete.appspot.com/ and turn it into this:

http://ascii-chan-ipnd-complete.appspot.com/ (Note the map that automatically is generated. The points on the map represent the locations of users who have added "art" to the app)
